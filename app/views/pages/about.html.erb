<h2>Zen</h2>
<div class="box">
    <p>Animals all by nature live in the moment, they have to in order to survive. They must be completely present in order to evolve their hightened senses. They rely on this presence to hear predators coming, sense prey to catch and eat, smell plants that are good for their diets, see pray and plants in the far distance and even intuitively sense all of these things at once. The feeling of being present is unconditional love, when there is an interuption in this sense of unconditional love fear fills the gap. Fear is the survival mechanism that causes animals to fight or flight. They fight when the cause of the unconditional love interuption is in close proximity, and flight when the cause of the interuption is farther away. When the fear is no longer nessesary, unconditional love naturally takes over again. This is how animals have survived over time.<p/>
    <p>Humans are animals too. We have evolved so vastly in intelect and mind that our others senses have taken a back seat to our minds. Humans are capable of walking past a garden of fragrant flowers and not even noticing, because we are too busy with whats going on in our minds or to busy caught up on our cell phones with the entanglement of our social lives. Any other animal would never miss those smells. Humans can be so caught up in what happened at work earlier that day or what they have to do at work the next day that they will miss breathtaking landscapes as they walk or drive past. Humans live so much in the busy mind that the majority of us will go through emotional turmoil without even noticing, we can feel fear without our minds recognizing it. Our minds may not recognize these fears and emotions but our bodies do, unchecked emotional termoil will cause negative health effects.<p/>
    <p>Not that it is at all bad to be human, quite the contrary, we are extrememly fortunate to have the minds that we do! The best part about being human is that we have these amazing minds that are powerful enough to image, create, logically solve mathmatical and physical problems, but mostly we are able to use our minds to connect with the present moment that all animals instinctively know. The practice of learning to be present is known as Zen. All we need do to complete ourselves as human/animals is to spend time practicing Zen, this will help us recognize and calm down fears and emotions as they arize even in busy stressful situations, all truly successful humans realize this. Most of our time that we waste is wasted in feeling bad, sad, bored, and uncertain. Having the experience to be present and see all situations through the eyes of clearity will give us the power to act with unconditional love in all situations guarenteeing a positive outcome. If all we experience are positive outcomes we will stop feeling bad, sad, bored, uncertain and all other energy waisting states of being.<p/>
