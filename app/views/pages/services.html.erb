        By nature dogs are pack animals. They are instinctual followers and require a calm/assertive pack leader to remain balanced and at ease. We must be 100% consistent with our dogs 100% of the time for them to view us as the pack Leader. Dogs understand the language of energy and Zen is the practice of experiencing life as energy. Positive energy always gives positive results.
